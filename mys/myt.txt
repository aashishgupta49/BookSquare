The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes

A delight for a public which enjoys incident, mystery, and above all that matching of the wits of a clever man against the dumb resistance of the secrecy of inanimate things, which results in the triumph of the human intelligence.

Crime and Punishment

From the Russian master of psychological characterizations, this novel portrays the carefully planned murder of a miserly, aged pawnbroker by a destitute Saint Petersburg student named Raskolnikov, followed by the emotional, mental, and physical effects of that action. Translated by Constance Garnett.

The Secret Adversary

Set in 1919, young couple Tommy Beresford and Tuppence Cowley form a partnership, hiring themselves out as ''young adventurers''. Their first case, however, is more of an adventure than they expect - working to find documents that, if they were known to the general public, would fuel a communist revolution in Britain.

A Study In Scarlet

The first story to feature Sherlock Holmes, wherein the detective resolves to solve the mystery of a corpse found at a derelict house with the word "RACHE" scrawled in blood on the wall beside the body. A story of lost love, revenge, and mystery!

The Hound of the Baskervilles

This may be the most popular of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Inspired by regional mythology of the British Isles concerning hell-hounds, the tale tells of detective Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson as they are called to investigate an alleged curse upon the house of the Baskervilles.

The Sign of the Four

This, the second Sherlock Holmes mystery, begins with Holmes himself in a cocaine-induced haze, interrupted by the arrival of a distressed and beautiful young lady. Each year following the strange disappearance of her father, Miss Morstan has received a rare and lustrous pearl. Now, on the day she is summoned to meet her anonymous benefactor, she comes to consult with Holmes and Watson.
